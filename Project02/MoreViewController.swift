In addition, the IRL-Health app uses three-week data to forecast the chance of an algal bloom over the next 6-7 days. After 8AM every day, the machine learning algorithm has a proven 94.95% validation acccuracy for detecting Microcystin throughout the Indian River Lagoon. Before 8AM, ML algorithm predictions have an unproven accuracy. \n\nThe machine learning model for detecting algal blooms has a 92.9% validation accuracy for dates 6 to 7 days in advance. With both models are displayed in the IRL-Health app, they have different purposes.\n\nThe Microcystin detection algorithms can alert users about currents risks in the Indian River Lagoon while the bloom prediction algorithms warn users about forthcoming risks with strategies to prevent these blooms."
